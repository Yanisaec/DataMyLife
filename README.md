## Data My Life

This is the draft for a software idea I had. 

The goal is to track habits and use algorithms and visualization to better understand them.

The app works and you could potentially use it, however I think there are still many bugs and issues as I stopped working on the project.

If anyone (even if I doubt it) finds the project cool, do not hesitate to fork the project and/or create pull requests.
